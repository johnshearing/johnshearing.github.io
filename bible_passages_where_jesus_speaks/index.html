The One Great Commandment<br>
<br>
</center>
</strong>
</font>
   
<font size="4">
Matthew 22:36-40  King James Version<br>
<br>
</font>

36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?<br>
37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt <a href="https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/index.html#Who_Is_My_Neighbor_And_What_Do_You_Mean_By_Love">love</a> the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<br>
38 This is the first and great commandment.<br>
39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt <a href="https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/index.html#Who_Is_My_Neighbor_And_What_Do_You_Mean_By_Love">love</a> thy <a href="https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/index.html#Who_Is_My_Neighbor_And_What_Do_You_Mean_By_Love">neighbor</a> as thyself.<br>
40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.<br>

Who Is My Neighbor And What Does Jesus Mean When He Uses The Word Love?<br>
<br>

</font>


<font size="4">
Luke 10:25-37  King James Version<br>
<br>
</font>


25 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?<br>
26 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?<br>
27 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.<br>
28 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.<br>
29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?<br>
30 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.<br>
31 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.<br>
32 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.<br>
33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,<br>
34 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.<br>
35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.<br>
36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?<br>
37 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.<br>

What Does Jesus Say About Our Attitude When Talking With God?<br>
<br>
</center>
</strong>
</font>


<font size="4">
Mark 11:23-26  New International Version<br>
<br>
</font>


23 “Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.<br>
24 Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.<br>
25 And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.”<br>
26<br>
<br>


<font size="4">
Luke 11:5-10  King James Version<br>
<br>
</font>


5 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;<br>
6 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?<br>
7 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.<br>
8 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.<br>
9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.<br>
10 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.<br>
<br> 


<font size="4">
Luke 11:33-36  King James Version<br>
<br>
</font>


33 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.<br>
34 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.<br>
35 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.<br>
36 If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.<br>

What Does Jesus Tell Us To Pray For?<br>
<br>
</center>
</strong>
</font>


<font size="4">
Luke 11:1-4  King James Version<br>
<br>
</font>


1 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.<br>
2 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.<br>
3 Give us day by day our daily bread.<br>
4 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.<br>
<br>


<font size="4">
Luke 11:11-13  King James Version<br>
<br>
</font>


11 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?<br>
12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?<br>
13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?<br>
