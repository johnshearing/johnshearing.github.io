Matthew 22:36-40  King James Version<br>
</strong>
</font>

 
36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?<br>
37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt <a href="https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/index.html#Who_Is_My_Neighbor_And_What_Do_You_Mean_By_Love">love</a> the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<br>
38 This is the first and great commandment.<br>
39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt <a href="https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/index.html#Who_Is_My_Neighbor_And_What_Do_You_Mean_By_Love">love</a> thy <a href="https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/index.html#Who_Is_My_Neighbor_And_What_Do_You_Mean_By_Love">neighbor</a> as thyself.<br>
40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.<br>

<strong>
Luke 10:25-37  King James Version<br>
</strong>
</font>

 
25 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?<br>
26 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?<br>
27 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.<br>
28 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.<br>
29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?<br>
30 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.<br>
31 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.<br>
32 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.<br>
33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,<br>
34 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.<br>
35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.<br>
36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?<br>
37 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.<br>

23 “Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.<br>
24 Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.<br>
25 And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.”<br>

5 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;<br>
6 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?<br>
7 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.<br>
8 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.<br>
9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.<br>
10 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.<br>

33 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.<br>
34 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.<br>
35 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.<br>
36 If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.<br>

1 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.<br>
2 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.<br>
3 Give us day by day our daily bread.<br>
4 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.<br>

John 14  King James Version<br>
</strong>
</font>


1 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.<br>
2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.<br>
3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.<br>
4 And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.<br>
5 Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?<br>
6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.<br>
7 If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.<br>
8 Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.<br>
9 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?<br>
10 Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.<br>
11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.<br>
12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.<br>
13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.<br>
14 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.<br>
15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.<br>
16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;<br>
17 Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.<br>
18 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.<br>
19 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.<br>
20 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.<br>
21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.<br>
22 Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?<br>
23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.<br>
24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.<br>
25 These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.<br>
26 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.<br>
27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.<br>
28 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.<br>
29 And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.<br>
30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.<br>
31 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.<br>

24 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.<br>
25 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.<br>
26 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.<br>
27 And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.<br>
28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.<br>

Sermon On The Mount<br>  
<br>

</strong>
</font>


<font size="4">
<strong>
Matthew 5 King James Version<br>
</strong>
</font>


1 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:<br>
2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,<br>
3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.<br>
5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.<br>
6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.<br>
7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.<br>
8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.<br>
9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.<br>
10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.<br>
12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.<br>
13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.<br>
14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.<br>
15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.<br>
16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<br>
17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.<br>
18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.<br>
19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<br>
20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br>
21 Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:<br>
22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.<br>
23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;<br>
24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.<br>
25 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.<br>
26 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.<br>
27 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:<br>
28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.<br>
29 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.<br>
30 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.<br>
31 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:<br>
32 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.<br>
33 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:<br>
34 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:<br>
35 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.<br>
36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.<br>
37 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.<br>
38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:<br>
39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.<br>
40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.<br>
41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.<br>
42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.<br>
43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.<br>
44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;<br>
45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.<br>
46 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?<br>
47 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?<br>
48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.<br>

1 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.<br>
2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.<br>
3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.<br>
4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.<br>
5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.<br>
6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.<br>
