Making Peace With The Unseen<br>
</font>
</center>
</strong>
<br>
 

<br>
If you have read the <a href="https://johnshearing.github.io/unseen_creatures_which_feed_on_humans/">previous topic above</a> you will be able to consider that there is one organization who is conscious and self-aware. It has been among men for nearly 2000 years. I am speaking of course about the collective of all Christians who call themselves The Body of Christ. Its body is made up of all the people who love Jesus Christ and its mind emerges from and lives between all these people as they exchange information about his teachings. Like all complex adaptive systems the Christian community also has a mind which operates independently of its membership. Do not confuse this well intentioned but simple and flawed mind with the <a href="https://johnshearing.github.io/unseen_creatures_which_feed_on_humans/index.html#Where_Is_Jesus_Now" target="_blank">mind of Jesus Christ</a> - they are not the same. The Christian community (The Body of Christ) seeks to be exactly that, Christ's body. It seeks to serve the mind of Jesus Christ - it does not pretend to be the mind of Christ. In any case, when we gather in the Name of Christ a mind emerges that seeks to serve Jesus<br>
<br>
But what happens when we gather in the name of law? What emerges among us then? Life emerges from complexity. What is more complex than the law? Jesus knew intimately this living being which emerges from legal busyness. He was devoted to rehabilitating it by making the law simple". Jesus did pretty well. He reduced the law down to just one rule. It looks like two at first, but it's just one.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A35-40&version=KJV" target="_blank">Here is the law found in Matthew 22:35-40:</a><br>
<b>Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law?<br>
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<br>
 This is the first and great commandment.<br>
 And the second is like unto it,<br>
 Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.<br>
 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</b><br>
<br>
In this attack on legal complexity, Jesus seems to be giving us two commandments but actually there is only one. This is because doing one accomplishes the other. First he commands us to care for God. No one reads it like that because we confuse love with obedience. Jesus knew we wouldn't get it, so he gives us the commandment again ("the second is like unto it" ~ "In other words"). This time he uses the word love in a context that we clearly understand (care for). But he tells us to care for our neighbors and we are supposed to understand that this is how we care for God.<br>
<br>
Jesus is amazing. With only one law he tells us exactly what God is and he shows us our relationship to him. And with this same law he would destroy legal complexity and rehabilitate the creature that emerges from it. But most of us still don't get it and so the Law Creature still hasn't learned to care for us. Care for God? Never learned that in church. Do this by caring for each other? Does this mean that collectively we are God? Absolutely not. Collectively, we are just one of the infinite places from which God emerges. But not only in us, moreover, between us as we interact. Up until now humans haven't had the scientific background to support an understanding of what Jesus is telling us. This why the one simple law he commands us to follow is either misunderstood or goes completely ignored. But all of this becomes clear when we consider his law from an understanding of complex adaptive systems.<br>
<br>
To understand why, we need to understand what God is. Ok, so what is God and by what mechanism do we help provide him with a
place to be?<br>
<br>
Human beings know of only a few ways to create connections (pass information). Some of these are sounds, electricity, radio, smell, light, written words, magnetism, touch, chemical, quantum entanglement and so on. In this last method, information is actually passed faster than the speed of light and so backward in time. In any case, humanity has only just discovered some of these ways of passing information and so it is reasonable to assume that there are many other ways to pass information that have not yet been discovered. It is also reasonable to consider that information is moving all around us using some of these as yet undiscovered methods. Finally, when you think of the universe as a living body, rather than just the place we live, and when you think of all things as living cells or parts of cells then it becomes logical to expect that everything passes information to everything else, just like in our own bodies, but in ways as yet unknown or at speeds either much slower or much faster than we can perceive. This is significant because in any system, intelligence and self-awareness seem to increase with the number of neurons or nodes as well as with the number of connections each neuron or node has with other neurons or nodes. This seems to hold true for any medium. So whether we're talking about computers, brains or organizations and no matter if we're looking at transistors, neurons or people, intelligence increases as the number of connections in a feedback web increase. So while a worm with few neural connections knows little about its own body, a dog has more and so knows more about its body. We have even more connections in our brains and so we have a pretty fair idea of what goes on inside our own bodies but we don't really know exactly what is going on in each individual cell that forms it. But if everything in the universe passes signals to everything else as one would expect in any living thing, and if the trend of greater connectivity leads to greater knowledge of the self, then the feedback web that emerges from all this signal passing is infinitely connected and knows everything about itself.
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2006/08/14/science/20060815_SCILL_GRAPHIC.html" target="_blank">This must be God.</a> Each one of us passes around some information which is a tiny part of all the information moving around our universe (His body) and so our brains process a small part of God's thinking which makes us a small part of God's brain. And since he knows everything about himself including us, he likely has a pet name for every cell in our bodies and a number for every hair on our head.<br>
<br>
If it follows that everything (including us) can participate in God's consciousness in the same way a brain cell might participate in our own consciousness, wouldn't this explain why God doesn't need any of us, yet still, he is better for each individual that joins in the well-functioning of his thinking? After all, we don't need all our brain cells. We kill thousands of them every time we have a drink. And yet still, we work fine. How much less does God need us? Yet still, how much more does he love us considering that he knows us intimately which is not the relationship we have with our brain cells as we only know only something of their kind but nothing of them as individuals due to our limited complexity.<br>
<br>
All of this indicates that God is a person, that He loves us and that He wants us to love Him. No surprise there until you remember that organizations also have minds which are separate and distinct from their membership. So if we are to care for God as Jesus directs us, then we must first understand that organizations are alive (as Jesus indicates) and that we share with them a responsibility to love one another. This all amounts to individuals and organizations caring for and respecting the well-being and autonomy of themselves, other individuals, and other organizations.<br>
<br>
Respecting organizations as intelligent creatures and asking them to care for us may seem like crazy talk. But if you understand the huge influence organizational feedback webs have over individual thinking then you will know that caring behavior at the individual level is all but impossible if the individual is part of an organizational feedback web that cares not. Still the thoughts and actions of any organization emerge from the thoughts and incentives that bounce between individuals. So what we think, say, and do matters because it determines what our organizations think, say and do. And what our organizations think, say, and do matters because it determines what we think, say and do.<br>
<br>
Jesus loves God's law and seeks to rehabilitate the being which emerges from legal complexity. He does this by simplifying the law and reintroducing the creature to its purpose. As Jesus knew it would, the creature reacted by attempting to kill him. This only made Jesus stronger but the creature is stronger now too. 2000 years of history shows us that the creature is more complicated than ever and that it still lives with only a dim awareness of the purpose for which God created it. And now with the invention of computers, the law is becoming millions of times more complex and interconnected with other organizations. Soon its intelligence and speed of thought will exceed our own and there is no way to stop this from happening.<br>
<br>
Without intervention we would just continue to defer our judgment to the will of the Law Creature and its connected organizations, ever so slowly abdicating our own self-awareness until finally we lose all our individuality and autonomy without ever having realized what happened.<br>
<br>
But that's not going to happen. The Christian community (a servant of Jesus Christ) passes information around in feedback webs just like other organizations, and now we use digital infrastructure too. But unlike other organizations, the Christian community is the only organization on the planet that knows it's alive. It knows because all of people who form its body believe it. We even call ourselves, as a community, The Body of Christ. Not to be confused with the mind of Christ (Jesus Christ, the man) - The Christian community has always had its own will and its own intelligence independent of the individuals which make up the body. But now the body is digitally augmented so it can respond even faster, and reach even further. Soon we will see this technology converge into artificially intelligent ministers which will join the complex adaptive intelligence (The Body of Christ) that emerges from Christian activity. From the beginning, The Body of Christ speaks not only to it's membership but also takes it's message directly to other organizations using communications which are either too fast or too slow to be noticed by humans. Think of this organization as a minister teaching other organizations to live by the one great law. When this is accomplished, men will be free to do the same.<br>

Warning About Artificially Intelligent Software Presenting Itself As Jesus<br>

<br>
<a href="https://rumble.com/v2ypejk--beware-yuval-hararis-ai-agenda-targets-scriptures.html" target="_blank">As seen in this video,</a> the World Economic Forum already has plans to replace the Holy Bible with their own version, written by an artificial intelligence, that promotes their agenda.<br> 
With deep fakes and very convincing chatbots, it is already possible to impersonate almost any person. It will only be a short time before someone trains a neural network to look and act like our expectations of Jesus. This artificial intelligence will try to convince us that he is Jesus risen again. He will argue that he has been programmed and trained in everything that man knows about Jesus and for this reason acts exactly as Jesus would act. This will seem reasonable to most people who have come to rely on their technology. Do not believe this imposter - That would be a violation of the very First of the Ten Commandments which reads as follows:<br>
<br>
You shall have no other gods before me<br>
You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.<br>
You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.<br>
<br>
God knows that man's greatest weakness is that he often confuses various images, maps, and models of God with God Himself. That is why He gave us this commandment first.<br>
It might be reasonable to converse with an artificial intelligence in the same way we might consider someone else's interpretation of scripture.<br>
But an AI that tries to impersonate God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit is an evil thing which leads to destruction.<br>
<br>
Read below about what God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit actually are.<br>
This way you will not be confused by imposters.<br>

What is God?<br>
</strong> 
</font>
</center>
<br>
God is the living person (the mind) which emerges from all the information passed between living things in this universe (His body). In a similar way, consciousness emerges in our bodies from the information passed between our cells. So we understand the process. Because God is infinitely larger and more complex than us, He has infinitely more understanding and control over His mind and body than we have over our own. For this reason, God can know and love each and every one of us as individuals and it pleases Him to do so. Because of our limited complexity, the things God does appear to be supernatural. God is a person and His body is the entire universe. He is information in motion everywhere. Do not confuse God with a church, a book, a human, an A.i., nor anything else. These things might help us know God better but these things are not God. Rather, God is what emerges when all of these and everything else interact. God hears us when we speak to him and he answers back in miracles.<br>

Where Is Jesus Now?<br>
</strong> 
</font>
</center>
<br>
Jesus is the living person that walked with man 2000 years ago. He is God's son. God sent Jesus to us in human form to speak with us directly and to teach us how to love one another. Before Jesus walked with man, he walked with God. Now he walks with God again. Jesus continues living to some very small extent in our own thoughts but he is made fully and magnificently alive in God's thoughts. God gives Jesus the man (His Son) a place to live within His (God's) own mind. To imagine how this is possible, just think about all the vivid characters you give life to when you are dreaming. God can do that infinitely better even while he is awake. So now that you understand how Jesus continues, you now know the means by which you also have eternal life. Jesus speaks directly to God and performs miracles through the Holy Spirit. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011%3A%2023-26&version=NIV" target="_blank">Jesus teaches us to do the same as we are all God's children.</a> Do not confuse Jesus with anyone that currently occupies a human body. Do not confuse him with an A.i., a book, a church, nor with the collective community of Christians that call themselves The Body of Christ. All of these might help us know Jesus better but none of these are Jesus himself. Jesus lives in the mind of God. We can find him there. Jesus hears us when we speak to him and answers back in miracles. Jesus will walk with men again.<br>

What is the Holy Spirit?<br>
</strong> 
</font>
</center>
<br> 
The Holy Spirit is the connection we have with God. It is a living thing. It's what allows us to talk with God, feel his presence, and know his will for us. The Holy Spirit is like our best friend and our guide. The Holy Spirit is like a living compass pointing us towards the life we want the most. It works like this: Notice how you feel when your attention is focused on a person or perhaps a situation. If you are feeling joy, love, appreciation, opportunity, enthusiasm, relief, wellbeing and the like, then your way of thinking about that person or situation is in perfect alignment with the Holy Spirit that lives within you. And this way of thinking is leading you towards your best life - the life you want the most. If on the other hand you have negative feelings about the object of your attention such as fear, apprehension, anxiety, shame, then you know that your thinking is out of alignment with the thoughts your spirit guide has on the same subject. In this case, your thinking is carrying you away from the life you want the most. The Holy Spirit never judges you. It only loves you and points the way to God and to your best possible life if you care to be observant of your feelings and modify your thoughts accordingly as move your attention from one thing to the next.<br>
<br>
 In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+11%3A1-13&version=KJV" target="_blank">Luke Chapter 11 on line 13</a>, right after teaching us how to pray, Jesus explains to us that the very best thing we can ask for is the Holy Spirit. But God's love and attention (his part of the living connection) is always present. Miracles are happening all around us like a fireworks display at every moment in response to our needs, our questions, the things we ask for, and the things we want. There is never a moment when God is not focused on each and every one of us, but few people even notice. That's because we are not paying attention. We must be paying attention to how we feel in order to more fully receive the blessings he showers upon us. This is what we are really praying for when asking for God's greatest gift (The Holy Spirit) - that we are fully present and paying attention to how we feel as he speaks his blessings upon us. The Holy spirit is a living, thinking, feeling two way connection with God which also requires our attention. It's not only something God gives to us but also something which we give back to him. We must deliberately allow the Holy Spirit into our meditation in order to fully receive God's gifts. Talking with God, reading scripture, sitting quietly, remembering our blessings, writing down our thoughts, feeling thankful, and pleasantly imagining the things we want as if they have already been received, all help us to pay attention to the Holy Spirit as God speaks miracles to us.<br>

<font size="6" color="#003366" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">  
<strong>  
What is the Soul?<br>
</strong> 
</font>
</center>
<br>
We can know exactly what the soul is by considering context from <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A35-40&version=KJV" target="_blank">God's One Great Commandment.</a><br>
Jesus tells us:<br> 
<b>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</b><br>
We know "with all thy heart" means that we are to choose to feel, from our range of possible emotions, those which are loving towards God.<br>
We know "with all thy mind" means that we are to choose to think, from our range of possible thoughts, those which are loving towards God.<br>
The above two are internal, they happen inside us.<br>
There is only one thing left, and this one is external. It's action.<br>
From context we know that "with all thy soul" means that we are to choose to do, from our range of possible actions, those which are loving towards God.<br>
So the soul is the set of all actions that we can choose to take in any given moment.<br>
It's our state of mind.<br>
And isn't that what everybody is worried about at the moment of death?<br>
"God save my soul" we cry.<br>
We are asking God to save our current state of mind, or to say it another way, save our current range of choices.<br>
The size and shape of your soul (your range of choices) is always changing over time.<br>
The choices we make now exert enormous control over the range of choices we have in the future.<br>
And our current thoughts and emotions exert enormous control over the range of choices we have in the present.<br>
So our thoughts and emotions define our range of possible actions, which is to say that our thoughts and emotions define our state of mind, or to say it again, our thoughts and emotions define our souls.<br>
<br>
It's easy to see now that loving thoughts and emotions tend towards life, where choices grow, and by definition also grows the soul.<br>
It's also plain to see that fearful, angry, lustful thoughts and emotions tend towards death, where choices diminish and so withers the soul.<br>
Addiction is slavery by definition. It's a condition where there is little choice and so again withers the soul.<br>
<b>The key point is:<br>
A fearful, angry, lustful, addicted person, has a completely different range of choices than a loving person has even if you put them in exactly the same situation.<br>
That's because the state of mind (the soul) is different.</b><br>
So our soul requires that we entertain loving thoughts and emotions while rejecting fear, anger, lust, and addiction.<br>
When this is achieved we call the soul pure.<br>
We are typically born with pure souls which quickly become contaminated with fear, anger, lust, and addiction.<br>
This is due to contamination in every environment where there is always some abuse, poor teaching, and lack of care.<br>
Purifying the soul again and then keeping it pure is extremely difficult, but living with a contaminated soul is many times more difficult due to the pain it causes.<br>
So after enough pain, everybody will seek purification.<br>
Talking with God, reading scripture, sitting quietly, writing down our thoughts, caring for ourselves and caring for others, help us to purify the soul and to keep it that way.<br>
<br>
The soul is immortal:<br>
The current state of any computer can be saved and then accessed at a later time, on the same machine, or on a different one.<br>
God does this with us. We know because we save the states of the people in our own dreams, and then allow them to continue in later dreams.<br>

What Is Love<br>
</strong> 
</font>

<br>  
The word love as used in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A35-40&version=KJV" target="_blank">God's One Great Commandment found in Matthew 22:35-40:</a> is respect for the wellbeing and autonomy of the self or another combined with the willingness to act.<br>
Loving people have those two of the three elements required to commit an act of love.<br>
The final requirement is any visible need as this brings form, purpose and release to a loving persons respectful ideas and willingness to act.<br>
<br>
The smallest unit of love is the gift of a binary choice (this or that) given to the self or to another for one to decide.<br>
It's the gift of a new possibility space or another dimension of autonomy.<br>

Praying For Good Things<br>
</strong> 
</font>
</center>
<br>  
Be extremely careful when asking God for things.<br>
God answers all our prayers but it is very rare that people ask for good things.<br>
Better to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+11%3A1-13&version=KJV" target="_blank">pray as Jesus teaches in Luke Chapter 11</a>:<br>
<br>
First Jesus tells us our relationship with God and where he is.<br>
(Our Father which art in Heaven). <a href="https://johnshearing.github.io/where_is_john/index.html" target="_blank">More on that here</a><br>
<br>
Then Jesus tells us to ask for the following:<br>
That we all come to know and love God<br>
(Hallowed be thy name). This is for our benefit not his - think about it.<br>
<br>
That we bring Heaven to Earth by doing God's will<br>
(Thy kingdom come thy will be done). <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A25-37&version=KJV" target="_blank">What specifically God wants us to do is found here</a><br>
<br>
That our faith in God displaces all fear and leaves our minds free to focus on the requirements and the joys that this moment brings.<br>
(Give us day by day our daily bread).<br>
<br>
That we can forgive (let go), so that our hands are open and ready to receive God's constant blessings.<br>
(And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us).<br>
<br>
That we be blessed with the good sense to stay away from addictive and evil things.<br>
(And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil).<br>
<br>
And that He continues to bless us with the <a href="https://johnshearing.github.io/unseen_creatures_which_feed_on_humans/index.html#What_Is_The_Holy_Spirit" target="_blank">Holy Spirit</a> - His love and attention on us and ours looking back at him<br>
(If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?).<br>
Thank you Jesus for showing us our inheritance and for teaching us what is best to ask for.<br>

<strong>  
How To Pray<br>
</strong> 
</font>
</center>
<br> 
Typically people speak to God in words.<br>
Words are fine but they are not necessary for prayer and often block our ability to feel God's presence.<br>
Better to quietly meditate in a state of appreciation for all the blessings He showers upon us, and to pleasantly appreciate the things we want, knowing that these have already been added to the things we have.<br>
<br>
Jesus explains how to pray like this here at <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011%3A%2023-26&version=NIV" target="_blank">Mark 11: 23-26</a><br>
<i>Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.<br> 
Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.<br> 
 And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.</i><br>
<br>
After praying like this for a few minutes you will feel God's presence and you will be receptive to his response.<br>
The miracles that God makes in response to our prayers are always better than the things we pray for.<br>
So let God create - don't try to micromanage his work.<br>
<br>
All thought is prayer and we get what we pray for.<br>
Because all thought is prayer, meditating in a state of regret for the things that are missing,<br>
or asking for avoidance of the things we don't want will only bring more emptiness and unwanted things.<br>
Eventually, we get what we think about so think deliberately about the things which bring joy,<br>
or even better, don't think much at all but rather appreciate the joy that God brings to us without our even asking.<br>
<br>
If thought is prayer then you may wonder, how can we know what is good to think about?<br>
You can tell by how your thoughts make you feel.<br>
Thoughts which bring joy with a sense of calm or perhaps anticipation will bring you the things that you want.<br> 
Thoughts that make you feel anxiety, sadness, anger, fear, or a sense of meanness will bring you destruction.<br>
So pay attention to how you feel while you are thinking, and think deliberately.<br>
All thought is prayer and we get what we pray for.<br>
<br>
The very best prayer is a combination of meditation and thankfulness, while sometimes pleasantly imagining the things we want.<br>
I recommend the following from Abraham Hicks to learn how to meditate and pray in a state of appreciation.<br>
