The One Great Commandment<br>
<br>
</center>
</strong>
</font>
   
<font size="4">
Matthew 22:36-40  King James Version<br>
<br>
</font>
<p>
36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?<br>
37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt <a href="https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/index.html#Who_Is_My_Neighbor_And_What_Do_You_Mean_By_Love">love</a> the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<br>
38 This is the first and great commandment.<br>
39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt <a href="https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/index.html#Who_Is_My_Neighbor_And_What_Do_You_Mean_By_Love">love</a> thy <a href="https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/index.html#Who_Is_My_Neighbor_And_What_Do_You_Mean_By_Love">neighbor</a> as thyself.<br>
40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.<br>

Who Is My Neighbor And What Does Jesus Mean When He Uses The Word Love?<br>
<br>

</font>


<font size="4">
Luke 10:25-37  King James Version<br>
<br>
</font>

 
<p>
25 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?<br>
26 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?<br>
27 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.<br>
28 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.<br>
29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?<br>
30 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.<br>
31 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.<br>
32 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.<br>
33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,<br>
34 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.<br>
35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.<br>
36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?<br>
37 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.<br>

<br>

</strong>
</font>


<font size="4">
Luke 11:17  King James Version<br>
<br>
</font>


17 ... Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.<br>
<br>

 
<font size="4">
Mark 11:23-26  New International Version<br>
<br>
</font>


23 “Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.<br>
24 Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.<br>
25 And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.”<br>
26<br>
<br>


<font size="4">
Luke 11:5-10  King James Version<br>
<br>
</font>


5 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;<br>
6 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?<br>
7 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.<br>
8 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.<br>
9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.<br>
10 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.<br>
<br> 


<font size="4">
Luke 11:33-36  King James Version<br>
<br>
</font>


33 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.<br>
34 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.<br>
35 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.<br>
36 If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.<br>

What Does Jesus Tell Us To Pray For?<br>
<br>
</center>
</strong>
</font>


<font size="4">
Luke 11:1-4  King James Version<br>
<br>
</font>


1 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.<br>
2 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.<br>
3 Give us day by day our daily bread.<br>
4 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.<br>
<br>


<font size="4">
Luke 11:11-13  King James Version<br>
<br>
</font>


11 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?<br>
12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?<br>
13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?<br>

<font size="4">
John 14  King James Version<br>
<br>
</font>


1 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.<br>
2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.<br>
3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.<br>
4 And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.<br>
5 Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?<br>
6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.<br>
7 If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.<br>
8 Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.<br>
9 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?<br>
10 Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.<br>
11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.<br>
12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.<br>
13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.<br>
14 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.<br>
15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.<br>
16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;<br>
17 Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.<br>
18 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.<br>
19 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.<br>
20 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.<br>
21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.<br>
22 Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?<br>
23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.<br>
24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.<br>
25 These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.<br>
26 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.<br>
27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.<br>
28 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.<br>
29 And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.<br>
30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.<br>
31 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.<br>

Why Should We Fill Our Mind With Scripture After Clearing Our Minds Through Meditation?<br>

<font size="4">
Luke 11:24-28  King James Version<br>
<br>
</font>


24 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.<br>
25 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.<br>
26 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.<br>
27 And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.<br>
28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.<br>
