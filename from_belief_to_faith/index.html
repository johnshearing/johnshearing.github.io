0. Faith is knowing so deeply a thing is true that we never even think about it.<br>
<br>
1. A belief (the opposite of faith) is nothing more than a thought we keep thinking.<br>
<br>
2. No one can break our hearts - It is something we do to ourselves. Not deliberately.<br>
2. Heartbreak happens when what we want is in opposition to what we believe we can have.<br>
2. Ultimately what we want is to feel good - That never changes.<br>
2. But what we keep telling ourselves we can have is something we can decide.<br>
<br>
3. You can not stop your life from moving, but you can steer.<br>
3. Mind is the rudder, Emotion is the compass.<br>
3. Pay attention to the compass - keep the mind on what feels good.<br>
<br>
4. Our minds exist to solve physical problems for the soul while we inhabit these bodies.<br> 
4. Solutions from God which come through the mind feel good. God will never send you a thought which feels bad.<br>
4. Like government which creates problems in order to grow and control, our minds do the same.<br>
4. Any thought that makes you unhappy is a thought from the mind which is seeking to grow and control.<br>
4. A quiet appreciative mind is where the soul meets with God. This is where good ideas come from.<br>
<br>
5. You can not stop any thought or belief from playing in your mind. You can only redirect your attention to another thought or belief.<br>
5. Direct your attention always to thoughts that make you feel good and you will be transported to your best possible life in a very short time.<br>
5. Direct your attention to things you believe you can have and you will be transported to your best possible life in a very short time.<br>
5. Direct your attention to things that you appreciate and you will be transported to your best possible life in a very short time.<br>
<br>
6. Practice quieting the mind through prayer and meditation in a spirit of appreciation rather than from a place of need or regret<br>
   and your belief in God will quickly turn to faith<br>
