Jesus tells to start our prayers like this:<br>
"Our Father who art in heaven"<br>
<br>
This line is taking up prime realestate in the Lord's Prayer so Jesus must be trying to tell us something very important about God.<br>
<br>
OK, where is Heaven? - The Bible shows us the way:<br>
<br>
Clue 1. The Bible tells us that we are made in the image of God.<br>
<br>
OK, so where are we?<br>
<br>
In our bodies, of course.<br>
<br>
God must be in his body too.<br>
<br>
But where exactly in our bodies are we?<br>
<br>
Let's ask our cells.<br>
Imagine our cells can talk with each other and that we are listening in on a conversation between them about one of us.<br>
<br>
Hey, Mr. Brain Cell, do believe in John?<br>
<br>
No Mr. Lung Cell, I only believe in real things that I can see. How about you? Are you a believer?<br>
<br>
Yes, I think so, Mr. Brain Cell. Every time I get cry out for air it just appears. My brothers and sisters have the same experience. We think someone hears our cries and feels our need. I think He loves all of us.<br>
<br>
No Mr. Lung Cell - That's just the way the universe works. Sometimes air comes your way and you think it's because of your prayers. You over estimate your importance. Anyway, if John exists, then show me where he is.<br>
<br>
Well I don't know where he is but he always gives me air and glucose - sometimes even before I ask.<br>
<br>
You see Mr. Lung Cell, that's because the universe is like a big clock. You have evolved to consume air at the same rate as the air comes. There is no John controlling this.<br>
<br>
Yes, Mr Brain Cell, but sometimes I need a lot of air and sometimes not so much. It's not a regular thing like a clock. I don't think the universe is a clock - I think the universe (John) is a living being like us. I think He is a person. I think He needs to eat and breath like we do. I think He needs to find a way to warm up when it's cold and cool down when it's warm just like us. I think he needs to fight his enemies (other kinds of universes) just as we need to defend ourselves against the bacteria which attack us. I think he needs to grow, and he needs to make more like himself just as we do. And just as we need to work together, I think He needs to work with this brothers and sisters (other universes like himself) to accomplish all this. Most of all Mr. Brain Cell, while we live inside John who loves and cares for us, I imagine that John lives inside of a bigger universe (a much bigger John) who faces the same kinds of challenges He does and who loves and cares for John the way he loves and cares for us. I think this continues up without end. Perhaps that's what it means when the Bible says we are made in his image.<br>
<br>
This may be a great place to show a fractal image.
<br>
Tell me Mr. Lung Cell, do you think this all starts with us?<br>
<br>
Perhaps Mr. Brain Cell, it continues down as well. What about all the tiny worlds inside of us, like the millions of ribosome protein factories inside our nucleus, or the many hundreds of thousands mitochondrion energy factories floating around inside of us which convert the materials given to us by John into the energy which gives us life. By caring for themselves and for their neighbors, the inhabitants of those tiny places love us into being. And we care for them too by making good decisions about our own health and safety. Do they even know we exist? They live their whole lives so quickly on their tiny little worlds. Wouldn't they just experience us as an ever so slowly moving universe. And what simple interests they must have compared to ours. And what simple interests we must have compared to John. And what simple ...<br>
<br>
Yes, Ok Mr. Lung Cell - I get the idea, but you haven't answered my question. If John exists then where is he?<br>
<br>
Well Mr. Brain Cell, I think it may be possible for things to exist even if they have no specific location. Consider the wind - when the wind blows it must be somewhere between here and the there but it's impossible to say exactly where because it's moving all the time. The only way to give the wind a precise location would be to stop if from moving. But then there would be no wind. The wind is not the same as air - the wind is what you get when air moves. I could ask you the very same question Mr. Brain Cell - Where are you? We can pinpoint the location of your body in the brain, but where exactly in your body are you? Your conscious self comes from thought which arrises from chemicals being exchanged in your body by the trillions of little living things inside you as they go about their own personal business. Like the wind, you have no precise location because these chemicals must always be moving in order to produce thought. And when the chemicals stop moving, like when you go to sleep, then you become unconscious and cease to exist for a time until the chemicals in your body start moving again causing you to wake up. So in the same way that wind is not air, you are not your matter either but rather what you get when matter in your body is exchanged between it's parts. It must also be like that with John. He arrises from all the chemicals that we cells exchange with each other as we go about our own personal business. And so (like us) He is not made of matter but rather arrises from trillions of transactions between the matter inside of him all happening all at the same time. The reason we can't see Him is because (as with our own consciousness) he doesn't exist so much as He happens.<br>
<br>
Yes, Mr. Lung Cell, I am starting to see. Your explanation reminds me of a poem that my sister Christina like to repeat. It goes like this:
<br>
Who has seen the wind?<br>
Neither I nor you:<br>
But when the leaves hang trembling,<br>
The wind is passing through.<br>
Who has seen the wind?<br>
Neither you nor I:<br>
But when the trees bow down their heads,<br>
The wind is passing by.<br>
<br>
I think I understand it now. It's about John.
<br>
Yes, Mr. Brain Cell, You must be right. That we can't percieve John with our senses is in no way proof that he doesn't exist. Furthermore, the miracles which happen all around us, the answered prayers, and the beauty of this universe are all very good indications that John exists and that He loves us.
