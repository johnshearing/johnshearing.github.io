## Work History
Job History

Most recently I worked for JLL as the Lead Troubleshooter for Controls & Automation at Amazon sort center CDW5.  
My job was leading the Controls Team in electrical, electronic, and software troubleshooting.  
I also handled the machine vision and deep learning.  
I worked for JLL at Amazon from April 2020 to April 2022

Previously I was employed at Bell Container in Newark NJ as the night time maintenance electrician. My primary job was electrical troubleshooting on robots and large computer automated machinery which involved work with PLCs, VFDs, instrumentation, and working with live voltage up to  480VAC. My other duties included welding, pump repair, machining new parts, mechanical repairs, pipefitting, ordering parts and supplies, electrical installations, and general electrical work around the facility.  
I worked there from October 2015 to June 2019

Previous to Bell, I worked at Masque Sound in East Rutherford NJ for most of my adult life.  
There I wrote accounting software in Delphi and SQL setup and ran the welding shop, the sheet metal shop, and the carpentry shop. I also made electronic gadgets of various sorts and installed industrial sound systems in many Broadway theaters 



Also I speak pretty good Spanish, and I am an FAA Certified Ground Instructor for student pilots - so I have the skill of teaching and sharing knowledge with others. At the following link is a video I made as a public service about how to avoid stall and spin accidents in an airplane. 
http://youtu.be/UJQsAxB7E4Q
The video has been seen by over 350,000 people, many of whom are pilots and student pilots. It has likely saved lives. I also make videos and write technical manuals about how to do specialized tasks or whatever else needs to be documented in the industrial environment.

Thank you for considering my application for employment, 
John Shearing
