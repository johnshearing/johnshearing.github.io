</head><body><h1>List of Pro and Anti Crypto Politicians</h1>

<p>
Politicians are listed with links to supporting documentation showing stance on cryptocurrency.<br>
Links with supporting documentation to stance on Government Controlled Central Bank Digital Currency (CDBC) is also listed.<br>
Generally I am assuming that politicians which are pro government controlled CDBC are anti crypto but this is not always the case.
Please send any links to articles that you would like listed to the following address.<br>
