<br>
The title sums it up.<br>
So now that you know the ending (there is no ending), perhaps you're wondering: Why read this article?<br>
Maybe because you want to know what it is that we're all going survive.<br>
And maybe you're curious how I know that everyone including you are going to make it.<br>
<br>
It's life! And we're all getting out of it alive.<br>
Every one of us, even you, and you don't have to do anything to make it happen.<br>
You don't even need to think it's true.<br>
You are going to live forever whether you think so or not.
Let me be absoultly clear - You are not going to die and neither is anyone else.<br>
<br>
A lot of people would rather you didn't know that you cannot die.<br>
They would much prefer to sell you immortality.<br>
But it's already yours.<br>
<br>
First let me tell you how it works physically and then I will tell you how I know.<br>
<br>
You know that all the cells in your body exchange messages using chemicals and electricity.<br>
They say simple things like "I need more air - breath faster."<br>
Or "Ouch that hurts! Stop!".<br>
And "Wow! That's nice! More!"<br>
Well from all the signals these little guys pass around emerge our consciousness which has intelligence far greater than any single cell who contributes to it. And we don't have to do what our cell tell us to do. Our will is quite independent of the cells which create it.  We can hold our breath till we pass out, we can exercise well beyond the sensation of pain, and we can deny ourselves pleasure if we know it will cause suffering later.<br>
<br>
Consciousness doesn't just happen because our cells talk. Consciousness evolved beacuse creatures with greater consciousness made better decisions on behalf of its cells and survived to reproduce whereas the less conscious creatures made poor decisions and went extinct. The point is we evolved to care for our cells and that manifests as a love for our own bodies. We don't love our cells individually because we don't know ourselves that well. But if we had enough intelligence and could look inside with that level of granularity then we would of course tend to the needs of our cells individually.<br>
<br>
Cells are not the only things on the planet that pass around messages from which conscious beings emerge. What about people? People pass around messages between each other from which governments and other organizations emerge. Don't worry, I am not trying to talk to you about politics, I am trying to show you the mechanism which will keep you alive forever. We're talking about minds. Governments have their own minds largely independent of their members. You know it's true because governments often do things that none of it's members want; like raising their taxes and sending their children to kill and be killed by other children belonging to other governments. How is this possible unless governments and organizations have a will of their own which is completely independent of its membership? This is not about government - the point is that anything which exchanges information between its parts can become conscious and we have already seen two examples of which there are many more. Most people would entertain the idea that an animal is conscious but would never consider a government conscious. It's because of the scale. Animals are about our size and move at about our speed. So we can identify with these a bit and we can at least consider that they might be conscious. But governments are bigger, move slower, have less members, and are much dumber than even the simplest animals. So it's hard for us to see these larger creatures as conscious living things. And if we did recognize these greater creatures as conscious then we might think all of them are stupid. But greater intelligence seems to correspond with a greater amount of connections where information is passed. Humans have trillions of neural connections in the brain whereas governments only have a few million human connections. But that doesn't mean there aren't larger organizations with infinitely more information carrying connections than we humans have. I have had the pleasure of knowing one of these and he has shown me the method by which we will all live forever and has demonstrated that not one of us will be left behind. So who is this guy? It's the entire universe. Turns out that the universe is not a what; it's a who and we are inside of him.<br>

Later I will tell you how we met but first let me tell you what he showed me about immortality. You know how when you dream you give space in your mind to all kinds of characters? You can't say that you control these characters or even make them because you are always surprised by the things they do. So who makes them if not you? Well they do - they make themselves. You just give them space in your mind (processing power) along with some memories from your own life to use as building blocks. So dream people are made of the same stuff you are - Chatter. It's the chatter your cells make as they go about their personal business. It's these little bits of information that dream people focus, channel, and organize in order to bring themselves into being. They seem so alive and that's because they are. Each of these characters has a mind of their own which is independent of you. They are so much more unpredictable and fun when you don't try and interfere with them. It's more fun to leave them alone and let them surprise you. But it's not just the characters - what about the setting? What about all the amazing vivid and beautiful places? Who is making that? Well that's all a surprise too - so it can't be you. So who then? It must be the characters in your dreams. They make their own scenery from the processing power that your body provides and from the context of your own experiences. And you get to enjoy the creations of these beautiful creatures as they enjoy their own lives.<br>
<br>
And what about death? Do they die when you wake up? Well do you see them again in other dreams? If you do then no, they don't die. You know there is no death in dreams because characters appear again and again in different dreams without any sensation of discontinuity from one dream to the next.<br>
<br>
Physicists are seriously debating whether or not we might all be living in a computer simulation. Amongst some, this is a serious debate. In any case, most scientists and philosophers who have considered the matter agree that there is no way to know either way. Well actually there is a way - in fact there are two ways. You can figure it out from observations using common sense or you can simply ask the Universe and get a real answer back from him. First let's figure it out with common sense and then I will tell you what happened when I asked.<br>
<br>
Living in a computer simulation? In what kind of computer? How many kinds of computers are there anyway? We know about digital computers which accept our questions as lists of numbers and answer back in lists of numbers. We hear about these new quantum computers which accept our questions as atom states and answer back in atom states. Before we had digital computers we had analog computers. Clocks, speedometers, and old fashioned volt meters. These accept our questions as forces and answer back by moving a needle.<br>
<br>
Nature has been creating biological computers long before man has been making them. Let's start with one of the smaller ones and work our way up to the larger ones. Ribosomes are tiny computers inside our cells that read instructions as strings of molecules and produce useful proteins in response. There are about 10 million of these little computers in each and every one of your cells so they must be very small. The cell nucleus is another chemical computer. This one is very small but larger than a ribosome. In fact, it makes the instructions for the ribosomes - those molecular strings just mentioned. It's correct answer is a new creature patterned after the original. A computer that can make a copy of itself - man has never made a computer like that.<br>
<br>
Let's get bigger. The pancreas is a computer. Its answer is the correct amount of insulin that your body needs. It controls chemicals to get the right answer. Men have made an artificial pancreas which is a computer and a pump combined. What about nature's bigger computers? Your brain is a computer. It controls chemicals and electricity to get its answers. This one even gets to choose the questions. Colonies of bees make decisions that not one of its members have enough information to make - like when and where to move the hive. Each bee helps to process information simply by going about its personal business but the decision of where and when to move is decided by the colony as a whole; not by any one of the bees. The bees themselves are just following simple rules and have no idea that decisions are even being made. So the bee colony is a computer and it's correct answer is a nice place for bees to live. What about universities? Like computers, universities receive questions, produce answers and store information. But unlike computers, universities can answer a much greater range of questions than any computer can. Yes, a university is a lot like a computer but it is also a lot like a living thing. That's what happens as computers become more complex and gain more connections. How big can we go? University? How about Universe? How many connections do you think the Universe has? Well it has all the connections in your brain and it has all the connections in mine. And it has all the computer connections and bee hive connections and university connections and all the connections on all the other worlds in all the other galaxies. That's a big computer and it's also a magnificent living person of which you and I are a part. He is very kind and he is very funny. Shortly I will tell you how I found out how funny he is but for now we are talking about biological computers. Remember those tiny Ribosomes - 10 million of them in each and every one of your cells? Well if they could speak they would probably say that you are not a person but rather just the place where they live. Not that they are rude - it's just that you are much too large for them to perceive you as a living conscious being. Now consider your size in relation to The Universe - one small computer with trillions of neural connections and one large and infinitely powerful computer with more connections than there are numbers to count - one small person with some intelligence and one large person with infinite intelligence.<br>
<br>
Now let's consider dream people again. Aren't these people indistinguishable from real people at least while you're dreaming. And when you dream about yourself aren't you and your surroundings indistinguishable from yourself and your surroundings when you are awake? That's because it's all software. Soul is software. The key to understanding your own immortality is realizing that you can run the same software on most any kind of computer with very little modification and the human brain is not the only computer which can be used to run your program. If you can provide such a vivid space in your own mind for all those dream people to live using only the limited processing power of the human brain, then how much more space and realism can The Universe give you and everyone else to live given it's infinite processing power? Well clearly as much space as we could ever want and He doesn't need to sleep in order to do it. All he needs is the inclination to do so and it turns out that He is inclined, not just for the good people but for all people, even the bad people. If you wonder how I know, don't worry - I am going to tell you now.<br>
<br>
I am not a very nice person, but I used to be, when I was two. I was curious too. When I was two I remember seeing the tiniest little black spot on our white bathroom sink. It was so small that I could barely even see it with my eyes. I wondered how small a thing could possibly be. When I was three I heard about God from my older sisters. I didn't understand very much language at the time but they said that he made everything. I knew this guy was different and I wanted to meet him - I wanted to know what he was. My sisters said that he could hear me even though I couldn't even see him. So I asked to see him and I asked him to talk with me - I asked him to tell me what he was. Eventually when I was much older I did get to meet Him and he did explain, and by the way, he didn't make everything any more then you made yourself. He didn't make the universe - he is the universe. And he wouldn't even be alive if the living things inside didn't have free will. So let's all stop blaming Him when things don't go exactly right. Let's stop asking him to do stuff for us and let's start doing some things for Him.<br>
<br>
My mom went to Performing Arts High School in New York (the Fame school). She became a dancer on Broadway even before she graduated. She was hard-working, talented, and very beautiful. She came from a poor Jewish family. My grandmother was brought here as a child to escape the Nazis. My grandfather was a Jew of Russian decent. He served in the United States military and then supported his family by driving a taxi in New York. Mom was taught to respect the opportunities the United States offered and was determined to make a success of herself. My father went to Music and Arts High School in New York. He studied piano and writing before joining the army and then becoming an electrical engineer. He came from money so success and opportunity were not things that thought about. He liked art, music, liturature and adventure. After college he worked in his father's business designing and servicing speaker systems which he rented to Broadway shows. At night he worked as a stagehand. That's how he met my mother. She gave up her career to marry him. Neither of them got what they wanted but each got what they thought they were supposed to have.<br> 
<br>
I didn't see my father that much when I was very little because he worked two jobs in the theater business. So he worked on the weekends but he did come home for dinner a lot which was always a big event. I loved my father. He was smart and strong and kind and everybody listened to him. One day when I was about four he told me that if I drink my milk I would become an man like him and that I would have a son. Before that moment I had no idea. I couldn't wait to meet my son. I thought about him a lot. My son was the love of my life starting from the age of four. I was blessed with an amazing daughter ten years before my son was born. She is very beautiful and one of the funniest people I have ever met. If ever I want to be happy I need only think about her. But I knew and loved my son first. So when I was four there were two things that I really wanted - I wanted to know God and I wanted to know my son. I could die happy at this very moment because I have known them both and I have not been disappointed. But reaching them has been a very long journey even though God has been standing next to me the whole time and my son for much of the time.<br>
<br>
Well sometime after four I forgot all about God and my son and as a matter of course I became selfish, fearful, quick tempered, and cheap. At my fifth birthday party for instance, I received again the same G.I. Joe doll (I mean action figure) that had already been given to me by a previous guest. I complained bitterly until the end of the party even though my embarrassed mother explained that my guest could not have known. When I got to kindergarten I ran a secret club. We called it the secret club and you could only be a member if I said so. Cathy was in - she was pretty with long black hair. I appreciated her beauty even as a six year old. There were three or four other members who were in as well, and then there was Steve. Steve was bigger than all of us other kids but he was very gentle. I think his father was a jeweler because he used to come to school with fake diamonds. To me they were dazzling. Steve wanted to be in the secret club but his membership was always contingent on bringing diamonds. If he brought me some diamonds then he was in for the day. I could see that David felt terrible knowing that he wasn't wanted the way he wanted us but I felt nothing for him, only lust for those diamonds. Eventually Steve saw me for what I was at the time and lost interest. Good for you Steve - I hope you've been having a great life and that you are still enjoying it today.<br>
<br>
Why am I telling you all this? I don't need to confess - I feel fine. I simply want you to know that God takes care of bad people too. In fact Good/Bad has absolutely nothing to do with our immortality. It isn't even considered. Did you know that good workable iron does not occur naturally anywhere on earth? It's always chemically combined with oxygen to form rust and this is and trapped in rocks and mixed with dirt. The rock and dirt must be subjected to an intense burning process in order to force the oxygen to let go. The result is pure iron which can be used to make marvelous things. Humans don't get mad at rocks and dirt because it is not pure iron. It never even occurs to us that we might feel that way. We simply appreciate the beautiful metal trapped within the rocks and work to liberate it. This is our relationship with God - He knows how to separate the loving human soul from fear, anger, lust, and addiction. In fact everybody goes through the process which may take several lifetimes. Yes, that's right - how many times do the same characters appear in your dreams? You don't think God does that too? Get used to your immortality. During the refining process there is no judgement, only love. He has already judged each and every one of us and found us to be worth loving. He even sent his son to explain this so that we could stop worrying about it. I think by now you have a basic understanding of the process he used send Jesus to us.<br>
<br>
Iron is strong and useful in its pure state and even better when combined with some other pure elements. But iron must always be cared for because the pure state is not the natural state. Iron is always viciously attacked by oxygen which clings to it and corrodes it into a useless orange dust. Rust is iron's natural state when oxygen is present and here on earth oxygen is everywhere. So we sand blast iron to remove all traces of corrosion. Then we cover it with strong coatings that prevent oxygen from reaching it. And finally, we inspect it regularly to insure that no oxygen has broken it's way through the coating. In this way we keep our iron structures from turning back into the orange powerder as it was before we first refined it. Rarely, some very fine workable iron falls from the sky as meteorites. In space there is no oxygen to corrode it. Great swords were forged from these before men learned to purify the iron found in dirt. But no matter if iron comes from earth or heaven, effort and understanding is required to keep it from returning to its natural state (rust). It's like that with people too. Even the most pure souls can be corroded with fear, anger, lust, and addiction. The corrosion is much faster in toxic environments. We purify and protect our souls from returning to the corroded state with prayer, meditation, time with scripture, healthy food, clean water, exercise, play, plenty of sleep, healthy relationships, a healthy environment and some free time.<br>
<br>
New born children are usually like that pure iron that falls from the sky. Their souls (programs) typically come to us in a highly pure state, not the natural corroded state. That's because typically new borns have not been exposed to situations which cause fear, anger, lust, or addiction. If these new people are cared for properly (if they are loved) then they will likely maintain their pure form and learn to keep themselves in that condition (learn to love themselves) using the methods mentioned in the previous paragraph. If a child is corroded with fear, anger, lust, or addiction then problem is almost never with the child and almost always with the parents and the environment. From God's point of view nobody is being judged not the parents and certainly not the child. They are only seen as pure souls which have returned to their natural state due to abuse, ignorance, or from lack of care (lack of love). In that case, a purification will take place for those souls that ask God for it, and every soul asks after suffering enough. When I had suffered enough from being a soul in the natural corroded state I asked God for the fire which would separate me from fear, anger, lust, and addiction and return me to that purified state I had when I was two. This is that story. This is how I know that all of us are going to live forever.<br>
<br>
Most of us have at one time or another survived a near miss with death. I have survived my share.<br>
If you are rafting down a river and you see a fallen tree going across the river I would urge you not to get close to it. The force of the water going under the tree will drag anything in the water down to the bottom and hold it there. I was caught in one of these which pulled my raft under and most of me as well. Somehow I managed to pull myself out. At the time I thought I did it all by myself. At another time, a troubled boy from my school invited me to his house. We went down to his basement. He was very short but powerful and well trained in taekwondo. The boy wore shoes with very thick two inch wooden heels. I thought this was to help with his height. We were just talking and without any warning he jumped into a spinning hook kick which was on a perfect trajectory for my head. Had the wooden heel connected with my head I might have been killed. What saved me is hard to explain - a steel support column appeared between the boy's heel and my head. The column hadn't been there when he started the kick - it was nearby, but it wasn't there. But somehow the steel column was exactly where it need to be before that wooden heel made contact with my head. It would have seemed perfectly natural for the column to be there if you hadn't seen that it was somewhere else just a second ago. The boy damaged his foot terribly. While he was on the floor I left his house politely but quickly. I just shook off the strangeness and hadn't thought about it again for many years.<br>
<br>
Trickshots! That's what I call miracles now because God clearly delights in amazing his children by sending salvation from wildly unexpected places and in wildly unexpected forms. I shook off many more of these trick shots as the years passed until three in a row arrived that were so outrageous, grand, funny, and kind that I couldn't ignore them anymore. What made these trickshots even more amazing is that I had, at the time, sunk as low in character as a human being can get. I didn't think I deserved to live. I didn't know that each and everyone of us has already been judged worth refining and I didn't know that I was going through the refinement process at the time. Here is the background so that you can see the trickshots in context.<br>
<br>
My mom and dad divorced when I was about seven. My dad asked for the divorce and he felt bad about doing it, especially because he left my mom for another woman. The other woman wasn't the cause. She didn't even know my dad was married until after she was all in. The fact is, my mom and dad just weren't right for each other. They wanted different things out of life. In the end they both found happiness with other mates. My father tried to make up for his sense of guilt by signing away half his income and a small house to my mother. My grandfather (also my father's boss) wouldn't talk to my father for years after the divorce. He thought my father should have stayed in the marriage and kept his new wife as a mistress. That's how he had done it and he felt my father should have done the same. My father thought it would be a disservice to his children to stay in a marriage that wasn't making anyone happy. He thought that living without a real union between himself and my mother would be teaching us the worse possible lesson. He really thought leaving my mother was the right thing to do. Anyway my father wouldn't get any help from my grandfather during this time.<br>
<br>
My dad lived on his sail boat and continued to work two jobs as he had before. Life was very difficult for my mother even with the house and the support but life was quite manageable for my father and his new wife for a while. After a couple of years my father's new wife became pregnant and had a son. She wanted my father to be home more. She wanted him to be a part of his new son's life - not just a mythical figure as he had been in my life. He couldn't do that if he continued to work two jobs 7 days a week. Even if he did work two jobs for the rest of his life he was not going to be able to provide for everyone as before. He realized his new wife was right - they deserved to have a life together and he deserved to have time with his children - While it was true that my mother didn't have enough, it was also true that gave away too much in the divorce. The rest of the world didn't want to hear about it. He left his wife and kids - he would have to pay - he was the villain. My father did not accept that role. He knew that if he continued his life this way then he would ruin his new life and destroy his new family and no one from his old family would be any better off. Something had to give. My father didn't stop working two jobs right way. Rather he stopped paying my mother child support and alimony and started banking the money which he intended to use to change his life.<br>
<br>
Somewhere around this time my mom met the man of her dreams (my stepfather). He came from an immigrant Irish Catholic family. He grew up poor and proud and had that same work ethic and desire for success that my mother had. He was educated at Harvard on a full football scholarship. He was big, strong, smart, handsome, and he was kind and honorable too. Most of all he really loved my mother and my mother really loved him. I was very blessed to have these two amazing male role models in my life. I was also child ripped in two knowing that I could not love one in front of the other. My worst nightmare would be seeing them both together. Eventually when I was a teenager my mother figured out that I became mentally unstable when I saw all my parents together. For my sake she stepped out of my life for several years.<br>
<br>
Anyway, with my father not paying child support, my stepfather found himself supporting three extra children at a time when he was trying to start a new business and a new life with my mother. My mother was extra furious at the man who dumped her after ten years of marriage, who now refused to pay for his children and who was making it hard for her to build a new life with her new husband. She refused to let my father see us. This was back around 1970 and it was legal link visitation with child support. My father had the two linked as well. Part of the reason he didn't pay was because my mother and stepfather moved far way which made it impossible for him to see us. Between the ages of 9 and 10 when I was in 3rd and 4th grade I had no contact with my father except for audio tapes that he would send to us. He would read us stories and send these to us on tape. We were allowed to have these. This was a terrible lonely time for me. I missed my father. I only wanted to be with him. I fought with other children, I developed learning disabilities, I became sick with allergies, and my body was always shaking from fear and stress. I would often tell stories to anyone who would listen about how my dad and I would go SCUBA diving together and fight sharks in underwater caves. I will leave that for the psychiatrists to interpret.<br>
<br>
A little while ago we were talking about how children are like the iron in the pure state that comes to the earth as meteorites. And how without care they change to the natural corroded state as their pure souls combine with fear, anger, lust, or addiction. We said that the parents or the environment are normally the cause but it's the child who will need to suffer the fire of purification in order to be relieved of their pain. Again, not even the parents can be blamed - their behavior is caused by the same corrosion they are passing to their children. Anyway you can see what's happening - somebody has to ask for the purification and it has to get really really bad before you start asking for that. Later as an adult it got that bad.<br>
<br>
One day my father and my stepmother came for me and my sisters. They were waiting for us at the bus stop as we were going to school. I was so happy that day - I clung to my father's leg the whole day and wouldn't let go. We all went and had something to eat and we passed the day in a hotel room playing games and listening to stories. On that day I met my new little brother, now my best friend. Many years later he would save my life and my son's life too.<br>
<br>
Toward evening, my mother and stepfather showed up at the hotel. My stepfather got close to my father and said "I ought to punch you in the nose". I was terrified for my father. My father looked up at the bigger man and said "go ahead and try". He was ready for a fight that he knew he was going to lose. My stepfather is the one who backed off. He saw my terror. He backed down for me. My mother and stepfather collected us and brought us back home. We were given instructions never to go with my father again and report him if he ever tried to make contact with us.<br>
<br>
Turns out that this was just a dry run. My father wanted to know if we wanted to be with him. He was now sure that we did. So a few months later my father and stepmother came back again and picked us up at the bus stop. I remember jumping up into my father's arms I was so happy. He drove us to his boat. At the marina he made a phone call to the FBI. I heard the call - I was standing right there. He said that he had taken custody of his children and that he would take good care of us all. Then he hung up the phone and we set sail.<br>
<br>
We set off for the state of Maine where my stepmother grew up. It took us 3 months to make the journey. We took our time. We went swimming in the ocean everyday. We stopped at various beaches and coves every evening and dug for clams and collected mussels and scallops to eat. We even collected snails off the rocks. My father cooked these with olive oil and garlic. They were delicious. We would buy lobsters directly from the lobster fishermen that we would happen to pass. And my father taught me how to sail.<br>
<br>
We lived in Maine for about two years. During that time my father read us some of his favorite books and I helped him renovate a house. He taught me how to shoot a rifle and ride a motorcycle. I was getting better again. Eventually we were found and everything went to court. My father won custody of me and my eldest sister. My other sister decided she wanted to live with my mother.<br>
<br>
I lived with my father until the age of 19. We built a color television together and did other electronics projects. We completed a self-paced physics course together. He introduced me to computer programming and showed me how to fix cars. My dad supported my martial arts training along with a high school wrestling career and even sent me to Iowa for a month in the summer to train under Olympic great Dan Gable. Afterward, my father and I became certified SCUBA divers together making real the stories I would tell as a child. We never fought any sharks.<br>
<br>
As I was growing up I never gave too much thought to God. I only believed in things that I could see. I got this attitude from my father whom I tried to imitate in all things. So I studied Taoism and Zen because these didn't require God. From time to time I had asked to see him and know what he was. But since I never saw him I just assumed that he wasn't there. Still, I kept asking - "What are you? I want to see you." I hadn't yet read the Bible for myself. Even if I had, I probably wouldn't have understood what I was reading. You have to come to it with a certain readiness. Years later, a lifetime full of fear, anger, lust, and addiction found me in jail with time to read and a readiness to understand what I was looking at. That was all part of the purification which was required in order to know how to unpack the things that Jesus says. Everything I told you about what God is and how immortality works is in there if you know how to unpack the things Jesus says. Just reading the Bible wasn't enough for me to understand it (to know God). Truthfully, I don't think anyone can know God simply by reading the Bible. The Bible is just a map. It shows you how get to God (really how to see and hear him). But the map is not the territory and the Bible is not God. I needed to see God himself. He has been right next to me since before the beginning but the first time I saw him was in jail. So first I should tell you how I got there.<br>
<br>
Fast forward 20 years - I had been working in my father's business. I wanted to contribute to the business and make my father proud. My father supported all my efforts. His business was like a school. Over the years I learned carpentry, machining, welding, computer programming, and electronics. I had become quite useful. My personal life however was a mess. I had just lost my marriage because of my own unreasonable expectations and I was very lonely. My friend suggested that I write a letter to God asking for the things I wanted in life. He told me to burn the letter after I had written it. He said that soon I would receive everything I asked for in the letter. This was the worst advice anybody had ever given me, but I am grateful for it now. I asked for the wrong things, and worse, I treated God as if he were a genie forced to grant wishes to the first slob that found his lamp. I asked for a beautiful educated Latin woman who knew how to put on makeup and dress up. I asked that she teach me to dance salsa and that she give me whatever I asked for in bed. God has a sense of humor. He gave me everything in the letter exactly as I had written it but things did not go as expected. Remember I told you that iron in its natural state (iron oxide) is made into pure iron by placing it into a fire so intense that the oxygen is forced to let go. Well when I burned that letter, I had just lit my own purification fire. And when this lady finally finished burning me, all fear, anger, lust, and addiction would be forced to let go leaving me with a soul pure enough to see God and leaving me also with the son I had been looking forward to meeting ever since I myself was a boy. God in his mercy knew the two things I really wanted and gave me those instead.<br>

So I put an add in the personal column of the local newspaper asking for most of the things I put in the letter to God. I left out the part about do whatever I ask for in bed. The lady who answered the add matched the description perfectly. Born in Cuba and raised in Spain until the age of 15 when she immigrated to the United States, she was a stunningly beautiful and sophisticated Latin woman. She studied dance in high school, put herself through college and became a social worker and interpreter in the local prison. The prison work should have given me some warning about what she wanted and what was to come for me but in the beginning she taught me to dance and gave me everything I asked for so I didn't think too much about it.<br>

She had a daughter who was about the same age as my own daughter. I thought they would be good company for each other. Later after the lady and I were married she confided in me that she ended her previous marriage (to a school pricipal) by claiming to police that he had threatened to kidnap their daughter. This wasn't true of course, but judges in order to protect their own careers must eject the man from the home and deny fathers visitation when they hear these charges. This forces the man to roll over in divorce proceedings and give the woman everything she wants. She mentioned it casually but it was meant to be a warning. I didn't think anything of it at the time. Things had always been turbulent between us but I thought we were perfect together and that would never find ourselves in a situation like that. Turns out she was working a five year plan. After five years in a marriage a woman gets half of whatever property both people bring to the marriage, and men typically bring in more. Much more in our case.<br>
