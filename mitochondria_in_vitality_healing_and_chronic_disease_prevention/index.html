  <h2>How to Power Up Your Mitochondria for Vitality, Disease Prevention and Healing</h2>

  <p>
    Life is an electrical process. At the center of it all are mitochondria — tiny organelles.<br>
    There are about 6000 mitochondria inside each of our cells that convert food into usable energy in the form of ATP.<br> 
    This energy powers nearly every function in the human body: movement, thought, cellular repair, and growth.<br>
    The more we understand and support our mitochondria, the more we support our health.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    "When mitochondria struggle, chronic disease follows. When we nourish them, healing begins."
  </blockquote>

  <h2>The Role of Electrons</h2>
  <p>
    Electrons are the fuel of life. Mitochondria extract them from food, but that process creates metabolic waste — mainly <strong>positive ions</strong>, which are missing electrons.<br>  
    These reactive ions damage nearby healthy tissue by stealing their electrons, creating what we call <strong>inflammation</strong> — a hallmark of nearly every chronic disease.<br>
    Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Free Radicals are other names for these positive ions which harm our bodies.
  </p>

  <p>
    The key to preventing this inflammation is twofold:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Reduce the number of positive ions produced by the mitochondria. 
        <ul>
          <li>Use sunlight, darkness, cold therapy, a ketogenic diet, and fasting to reduce ROS production.</li> 
          <li>Practicing meditation with slowed breathing, and taking time to give prayers of appreciation also reduce ROS production.</li>          
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Supply the body with free electrons from both antioxidant foods and from non-food sources like the earth, In this way, healthy tissues will not be scavenged for electrons.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h2>🔬 Mitochondria and Light:</h2>
  <p>
    Mitochondria convert nutrients like glucose and fatty acids into a form of usable energy called ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through a process known as <em>oxidative phosphorylation</em>.<br>
    This process doesn’t require light — it's powered by chemistry inside the cell.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, recent research shows that <strong>red and near-infrared light (600–1100 nm)</strong> can <em>directly enhance mitochondrial function</em>, especially in stressed or damaged cells.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The key molecule involved is <strong>cytochrome c oxidase</strong>, part of complex IV in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.</li>
    <li>This molecule absorbs photons in the red/NIR spectrum.</li>
    <li>Photon absorption increases electron transport, reduces oxidative stress, and boosts ATP production.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is the basis for red light therapy (photobiomodulation) and the recommendation to receive natural sunlight — especially during sunrise and sunset, when red and NIR light are most abundant.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Benefits include:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Enhanced wound healing</li>
    <li>Reduced inflammation</li>
    <li>Improved cognitive function</li>
    <li>Support for mitochondrial recovery in chronic illness</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>In summary:</strong> Mitochondria don’t require light to function, but under the right conditions, light can supercharge their output and help restore balance in the body.
  </p>

  <h2>11 Practices to Support Mitochondrial Health</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Sun Exposure at Moderate Angles:</strong><br>
      Aim for times when your shadow is your height or longer (30–45° sun angle).<br>
      This corresponds to morning and evening times.<br>
      When your shadow is twice the length of your height then you are getting sunlight at a safe intensity and with the best spectrum for maximum benefit.<br>
      This provides both red/NIR light and modest UVB for vitamin D synthesis — both are critical for mitochondrial and immune function.<br>
      At sunrise and sunset, there is no UVB light reaching the earth, but red/NIR is still reaching the earth and helping your mitochondria produce more energy with less inflamation.<br>
      Red and NIR light when seen at sunrise and sunset, are important signals for your body's circadian rhythm which is key for both physical healing and psychological well being.<br>
      So seek every opportunity to watch the sun rise and set.<br>
    </li>    
    <li>
      <strong>Exercise:</strong> All exercise greatly increases your mitochondria's capacity to produce the ATP energy required for repair, mental function, and motion.
    </li>      
    <li>
      <strong>Ketogenic Diet with Greens for Fiber:</strong> Sugar, starches, and carbohydrates in general produce a very high amount of positive ions (inflammation) when metabolized.<br>
      Protein creates a moderate amount of positive ions when metabolized.<br> 
      When the body is in ketosis, metabolizing ketone bodies produces no positive ions (no inflammation).<br>
      This clean energy metabolism lowers inflammation and so reduces risk for chronic disease.<br>
      Ketosis is typically achieved when very little or no carbohydrates are consumed for a period of 24 hours.<br>
      At this point, the liver is exhausted of its glycogen (sugar) reserves and will now convert fat to ketone bodies and this will be used by the mitochondria for fuel instead of glycogen.<br>
      Ketone bodies burn clean. Fat does not burn clean. So if the body is not in ketosis, then there is no benefit to eating fat.<br>
      The benefit of a high fat diet is only achieved when little or no carbohydrates are consumed. Otherwise, you are causing more harm than good.<br>
      Also, the fat consumed must be from animal sources (meat, fish, eggs, cheese).<br>
      Fats from seed oils are poisonous<br>
      While there are many health issues with seed oils, perhaps the least known and most damaging to mitochondria are the high levels of deuterium in seed oils.<br>
      Deuterium wrecks your mitochondria, and seed oils have a much higher deuterium content compared to animal fats, especially grass-fed animal fats.<br>
      Plants, including those used to produce seed oils, tend to store more deuterium in their cellular structures, particularly in their fruits and seeds.<br>
      This also explains why grass fed beef, dairy, and free range chickens and eggs have much less deuterium than grain fed beef and chicken.<br>
      And while green leafy vegetables (kale, collard greens, ...) have much less sugar than seeds and vegetables, they also contain much less deuterium, and are high in antioxidants.<br>
      This makes greens the only choice for fiber.<br>
      All vegetables are washed and eaten raw to preserve nutrition (coherence) and to reduce the amount of sugar the body can extract from these foods.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Intermittent Fasting:</strong> Fasting initiates ketosis within 24 hours and initiates autophagy (cellular cleanup) within 48 hours.<br>
      Autophagy enhances mitochondrial efficiency and removes damaged cells from the body.<br>
      I personally fast 60 hours every week.<br>
      My last meal is dinner on Sunday and then the fast starts.<br> 
      The fast is ended at breakfast Wednesday morning.<br>
      On the other 4 1/2 days of the week I eat mostly meat, fish, eggs, and cheese.<br>
      Tomatos, apples, berries, 100 percent dark chocolate (zero sugar), pumkin seeds, and leafy greens are the only carbohydrates I consume.<br>      
      These provide Vitamin C, fiber, minerals, and antioxidants.<br>
      Avoid breaking a fast with carbs. This can cause a dangerous insulin spike.  
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Avoid the Unnatural:</strong> Avoid Sugar, Processed foods, Food produced with pesticides, Seed oils, Grains, Meat and eggs from grain fed animals, Medicines and drugs, Alcohol and cigarettes. Avoid man made electromagnetic energy like 5G environments, living near power lines, TENS devices. Avoid angry or fearful people.
    </li>      
    <li>
      <strong>Red Light at Night:</strong> Blue and white light at night disrupts circadian rhythms. Use red-filtered light at night in the home and on computers and phones to signal the body that it’s time for repair, not activity.<br>
      Melanin, the most powerful antioxiant, which the body uses to stop inflammation, is produced during the day inside your mitochondria when the body is exposed to near infrared light (sunshine).<br> 
      At night, melanin is produced in the pineal gland and released into the bloodstream, but only if the body is given the required signal through the eyes. The required signal is complete darkness.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Prioritize Sleep:</strong> Deep sleep is when the body repairs mitochondria and clears cellular debris. Red light at night (or better, darkness) and going to sleep early support melatonin production.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cold Showers:</strong> Cold exposure activates mitochondrial biogenesis (the creation of new mitochondria).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Grounding:</strong> Standing barefoot on natural earth allows you to absorb electrons from the ground.<br>
      Earth is negatively charged — it acts as a source of antioxidant electrons that neutralize positive ions and stop inflammation (the cause of all chronic disease). 
    </li>      
    <li>
      <strong>Meditation:</strong> Reducing mental stress lowers cortisol, reduces sugar in the blood, and preserves energy for healing.<br>
      Techniques such as deep, slow breathing through the nose can support overall health in the body by reducing mental stress.<br>      
      Practicing controlled breathing techniques such as Wim Hof breathing increases the body's ability to produce antioxidants which, over time, reduces the levels of hydrogen ions produced through cellular respiration.<br>
      Mindful breathing, quieting your thoughts, and paying attention to this moment is a gift to your mitochondria.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Prayer:</strong> For me this just means taking the time to appreciate God's blessings and to listen for thoughts which come from the Holy Spirit.<br>
      I always meditate before prayer so that my mind is quiet enough to hear God.<br>
      I always know when God is talking to me because the thoughts from Him are always filled with love and a sense of peace. 
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    These practices are simple, free, and deeply human. They connect us to the earth, the sky, our biology, and the divine — and they give our mitochondria the support they need to help us heal.<br>
    This is not just an experiment. It is an act of faith in God, in nature, in light, and in life itself.      
  </p>


  <h2>Hormetic Stress vs Chronic Stress</h2>
  <p>
    Hormetic stress is short lived. When repeated after intervals of rest, hormetic stress will improve health and resilience<br>      
    Chronic stress endures over a long time. It gradually diminishes health and eventually leads to death.<br>
    One should seek hormetic stresses and avoid chronic stresses in order to improve mitochondrial health.<br>
  </p>

  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Enjoy early and late day sun along with short intervals of midday sun. Avoid roasting for long intervals in midday sun.</li>      
    <li>Seek short periods of intense exercise. Avoid hard labor without appropriate rest.</li>
    <li>Perform breath holding exercises (Wim Hof breathing). Avoid smoking or long exposure to poorly ventilated areas.</li>
    <li>Get adequate rest. Avoid a sedentary lifestyle.</li>
    <li>Take a cold shower. Avoid long term exposure to cold.</li>
    <li>Enjoy a hot sauna. Avoid working long hours in the hot sun.</li>
    <li>Fast at regular intervals. Avoid malnutrition associated with sugar, starch, and processed foods.</li>
    <li>Share information in an honest debate. Avoid arguing all the time.</li> 
    <li>Fast at regular intervals. Avoid chronic malnutrition associated with sugar, starch, and processed foods.</li>      
  </ul>    


  <h2>Chronic Diseases Linked to Mitochondrial Dysfunction</h2>
  <p>
    Scientific research increasingly shows that impaired mitochondrial function is involved in a wide range of chronic diseases.<br>
    Because mitochondria are responsible for energy production in nearly every cell of the body, their dysfunction affects tissues with high energy demands<br>
    Tissues like the brain, heart, muscles, liver, and immune system.<br>
    Supporting mitochondrial health through light exposure, diet, fasting, sleep, and other natural means may help prevent or even reverse many of these conditions.

    It reconnects us with the natural rhythms and inputs our biology evolved to expect — and that may be the most powerful medicine of all.
  </p>

    <h2>Can Supporting Mitochondrial Health Help Prevent Cancer?</h2>

  <p>
    Yes, emerging evidence suggests that improving mitochondrial function may play a key role in preventing cancer. While cancer is a complex, multifactorial disease, researchers are increasingly recognizing that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to its development, progression, and resistance to treatment.
  </p>

  <h3>🔬 How Mitochondria Are Linked To Cancer</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Regulation of Apoptosis (Cell Death):</strong> Healthy mitochondria help trigger apoptosis — a natural process that eliminates damaged or precancerous cells. Dysfunctional mitochondria may allow abnormal cells to survive and proliferate.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Oxidative Stress and DNA Damage:</strong> Damaged mitochondria produce excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can harm nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, leading to mutations and cancerous changes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Warburg Effect:</strong> Many cancer cells suppress mitochondrial energy production and rely on sugar fermentation (glycolysis) even when oxygen is present. Restoring mitochondrial function may reverse this cancer-prone metabolic state.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Immune System Support:</strong> Mitochondria are vital for immune cell energy and communication. Dysfunction can weaken immune surveillance and allow tumor cells to evade detection.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    While mitochondrial support is not a replacement for medical screening or treatment, it may serve as a powerful strategy for prevention — helping the body eliminate abnormal cells, maintain healthy immune function, and prevent the metabolic imbalances that underlie many forms of cancer.
