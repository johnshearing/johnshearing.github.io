<strong>
Take Control Of Your Cryptocurrency Before Someone Else Does<br>Get It Off The Exchanges<br>Secure Your Cryptocurrency On A Hardware Wallet<br>

You have control (ownership) of your cryptocurrency when you hold the private keys to your funds.<br>
If an exchange is holding your private keys then they control your funds, not you.<br>
<a href="https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s">A Ledger Nano S</a> or similar hardware wallet securely stores your private keys and ensures that only you can access your cryptocurrency.<br>
A hardware wallet used correctly ensures that no criminal, or government agency can hack your cryptocurrency accounts even if you are using a computer which has been infected with malware.<br>
<br>
Do not leave your cryptocurrency on an exchange like Coinbase or Kraken.<br>
If you do then they have the private keys, not you.<br>
If the exchange takes your money then you can't get it back.<br>
If the exchange closes then you can't get your money back.<br>
If the government closes the exchange or makes cryptocurrency illegal in your country then you can't get your money back.<br>
If someone hacks your account on the exchange then you can't get your money back.<br>
If you lose a lawsuit then a judge can confiscate your exchange accounts and give it to your adversary just like a bank account.<br>
Most of all, the exchange may be lending your money to industries that you do not agree with just like a bank does.<br>
Get your cryptocurrency off the exchanges and take full control of your own money by using a hardware wallet.<br>
<br>
Cryptocurrency is a way to decentralize financial power.<br>
The idea is to give citizens full control of their money and empower them to use this control collectively.<br>
Cryptocurrency is transparent - everyone knows what you have and where you spend it so it is not very useful to criminals or corrupt politicians.<br>
This is transparent money controlled by individuals.<br>
Imagine what we can all do together.<br>
<br>
Cryptocurrency is money that people, organizations, and governments cannot take from you without permission.<br>
Of course criminals and governments can force a very few of us to hand over our private keys against our will but because there is no central control over cryptocurrency it is impossible to do this on a mass scale. With regular dollars for instance, the government takes your money without even taxing you. They do this by printing more money. This gives the government more money to spend but it diminishes the value of the dollars you manage to save. They effectively take your money without your permission and spend it on things like wars and imprisoning black people which are expenditures that you may not agree with. Governments cannot do this if citizens hold their wealth in cryptocurrency.<br>
<br>
Order a <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s">A Ledger Nano S</a> or a Ledger Nano X right away.<br>
I am not affiliated with the Ledger company in any way - I just think the make an essential product for people who use cryptocurrency.<br>
Here is some information to think about while you are waiting for your Ledger Nano S or X to arrive.<br>
<br>
Always leave your cryptocurrency in a wallet controlled by your Ledger Nano S or Nano X.<br>
This protects your account from hackers.<br>
If your family depends on your cryptocurrency then you must assume that your computer has already been hacked.<br>
If used correctly, the Ledger Nano S protects your accounts even if the computer you are using to access your funds has been hacked.<br>
<br>
If you are not familiar with cryptocurrency already it may take some time to set this all up.<br>
Here is some information to get started.<br>
<br>
Go to the following website and follow the instructions.<br>
https://www.ledger.com/start/<br>
<br>
Then just play around with the device to get familiar with it.<br>
You are not working with cryptocurrency yet and you can't hurt the device by playing with it.<br>
<br>
When you start working with cryptocurrency please keep the following in mind.<br>
You are responsible for your own security and for following the correct procedures when making transactions.<br>
There is no one to help you if you send money to the wrong address.<br>
So when you move money with the device, move only a small amount first and see what happens.<br>
If the cryptocurrency arrives in the intended account then you can send larger amounts.<br>
Better to send funds in several smaller transactions than one large transaction.<br>
<br>
I own Ethereum, Cardano, and IOTA.<br>
I am not a financial advisor and I cannot guarantee results.<br>
The only thing I can guarantee this that the prices will swing wildly in both directions.<br>
In my experience however, I noticed that the prices eventually will go higher then the original purchase price.<br>
So do not purchase more than you can afford to lose.<br>
This way you will not become afraid and sell for coins for less than you paid.<br>
<br>
That said. Cardano is the only cryptocurrency I would recommend buying right now.<br>
This is because Cardano transaction fees are very low,<br>
Because Cardano uses 10,000 times less energy than Bitcoin,<br>
Because Cardano pays 5% interest when you stake it,<br>
Because you still hold the private keys when you stake it which is not the case with other cryptocurrencies that offer staking,<br>
Because Cardano is the most decentralized of all major cryptocurrencies,<br>
Because the Cardano technology is based on peer reviewed papers and mathmatical proofs,<br>
Because Cardano code is open source,<br>
Because Cardano has smart contracts,<br>
Because Cardano has decentralized identity management (you own your own identity and manage it as you please),<br>
Because community governance and voting is built into the Cardano blockchain,<br>
And because the Cardano community is actively working to bring decentralized finacial services all the people in the world that cannot get centralized banking services<br>
(most of the people on planet do not have access to banking services).<br>
These are the reasons I purchase Cardano but that is no guarantee that the prices will go up (The market swings wildly).<br>

Getting Started with Your Nano Device.<br>
When you first turn on your device it will ask you to select a pin code.<br>
Do not use any number that can be guessed.<br>
Pick a completely random pin code (8 digits long) so that no one will guess it.<br>
If you write down the pin code on paper - never store the pin code and the device together.<br>
If someone finds both the device and the pin code together then they can take your funds.<br>
You must assume that all your electronic devices have already been hacked.<br>
So never store the pin code on your computer, phone, camera or any other electronic device.<br>
Never let anyone see your pin number, not tech support, not even your closest friends and relatives.<br>
Don't worry if you forget the pin code.<br>
If you forget the pin code then you can just re-enter the 24 words and then pick a new pin code.<br>
More on the 24 words later.<br>
If someone finds your device and enters the pin code incorrectly 3 times then the device will erase all the data on it.<br>
This is not a problem as long as you still have the 24 words for the device and the 25th word for each account.<br>
More on the 25th word later.<br>
You can use these to set up a new device to control your accounts if your original device is stolen.<br>
<br>
24 words are generated by the device when you set it up as a new device.<br>
Write down these 24 words.
Never let anyone see your 24 words, not tech support, not even your closest relatives.<br>
Safely store at least 2 copies of your 24 words in separate private and secure locations.<br>
If you lose the device it's no big deal assuming the pin number used to turn on the device is random and cannot be guessed.<br>
But if you lose the 24 words then you lose all your funds should the device become stolen.<br>
If someone finds your 24 words then they can set up a new device to move the funds out of your accounts.<br>
Setting up a 25th word for each account offers pretty good protection in case the 24 words are stolen.<br>
More on the 25th word later.<br>

Be sure to set a 25th temporary passphrase to create new accounts.<br>
You will find that on the device menu under Settings>Security>Passphrase>Set up passphrase>Set temporary>Enter passphrase
You can have as many accounts as you want.<br>
Each account uses its own unique 25th temporary passphrase.<br>
After you turn on the device, just enter the unique 25th word to access the account for that passphrase.<br>
The following article explains:<br>
https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005214529-Advanced-passphrase-security<br>
Never keep the 25th word for each account with the other 24 words.<br>
This way if someone finds the 24 words they will still need to guess the 25th word.<br>
The following video explains:<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3xIsdtmgck<br>
Never forget the 25th word that you use to access each account.<br>
If you lose this 25th word you will lose all your funds for that account.<br>
Make 2 copies of the 25th word for each account and store them in separate secure private locations.<br>
Do not store the 25th word with the original 24 words.<br>
Never let anyone see your 25th word, not tech support, not even your closest relatives.<br>
<br>
You will need to install the Ledger Live application on your computer.<br>
You can find this application at https://www.ledger.com/start<br>
You will use this to update the firmware on your Nano S if required and then to install the Cardano application on your Nano S device as well.<br>

Remember: Keep your 24 words, your 25th word, and your pin number a secret. Never share these with anyone, not with tech support, even with your closest relatives.<br>
